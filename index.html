        <h4>Game Development Technology / April 2014 - Sept 2018</h4>
        <p>
          In order to reach the level of performance video games need to simulate worlds in real-time, I studied
          algorithms that are highly optimised for multicore memory hierarchies, allowing them to utilise all CPU cores
          efficiently. I implemented these algorithms in C/C++ for various projects.

      <h3>Trampolene</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>Mobile Application Developer / May 2018 - Oct 2019</h4>
        <p>
          I spearheaded the initial design and development of Trampolene's mobile application. Using C#, Unity, and
          Vuforia, I provided immersive Augmented Reality experiences to seniors suffering from Dementia. Using markers
          placed around the room, I was able to overlay iconic landmarks from the patient's childhood into the
          environment and have them interact with these childhood memories as if they were there.

        <h4>Corporal / Nov 2019 - Nov 2021</h4>
        <p>
          I mainly worked as a carrier, shipping classified documents between army bases. I adhered to rigorous security
          procedures, sent live reports, and kept to a tight schedule. I often used python scripts on my phone to help
          automate the process.

        <h4>Cloud Solutions Architect / Sept 2022 - Current</h4>
        <p>
          Starting as a QA automation tester, I quickly worked my way up to eventually becoming a full-on Cloud
          solutions architect. As the main architect for Quantify, I was responsible for improving the performance of
          the cloud-native application. I made each microservice stateless, where multiple instances of the same
          microservice can start and stop on demand without the need to sync up state, reduced the amount of locking
          needed when executing PostgreSQL queries in parallel, did Ahead-Of-Time compilation using GraalVM to reduce
          startup times, allowing services to better respond to sudden high loads, allowed asynchronous communication
          between services using RabbitMQ, and finally, compressed each microservice into a single, small, independent
          executable that the Linux kernel can run directly without any additional programs, deamons, nor libraries.
