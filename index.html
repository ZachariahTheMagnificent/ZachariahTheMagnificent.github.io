      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>1TX / Cloud Solutions Architect / Sept 2022 - Current</h4>
        <p>
          Working in a small startup, I was expected to be able to work in multiple different positions simultaneously.
          Starting as a QA automation tester, I quickly worked my way up to doing frontend and backend web development,
          mobile development, DevOps, and even becoming a full-on Cloud Solutions architect.
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My initial tasks primarily involved using JMeter to conduct performance testing on the backends of various
            web applications. The test was distributed among multiple computers running simultaneously to simulate high
            loads.
          </li>
          <li>
            Very often, we didn't have documentation on hand for the backend services so I had to record the HTTP
            traffic sent in and out from the browser when doing usual user actions, analyse the HTTP contents and
            headers, then simulate them in a JMeter script.
          </li>
          <li>
            The results of the performance tests were given to a Python script I wrote to generate HTML reports with the
            help of Jinja templates.
          </li>
          <li>
            My proficiency in Python led me to taking over the Flask empowered Discovery Engine, a Web application
            designed to use ML algorithms to search for the relevant solutions to specific problems. Using NLTK, Pandas
            and Scikit, I learnt how to tokenize texts, turn them into vectors, and use those vectors to find the most
            relevant solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            As I rapidly proved my skills, I eventually was given access to the Jenkins instance where I configured
            CI/CD pipelines to develop, test, and deploy the web applications I worked on. These pipelines get executed
            automatically on a periodic basis, generating security, performance, and code quality reports that get sent
            to various interested parties through e-mail.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because of my previous experience with Mobile development and Flutter, I was also tasked with training
            people to develop an internal mobile application that automates certain security processes. The application
            also had to be designed to work on Desktop too. I taught them the basics of Dart and how to use Flutter to
            develop applications that could work on both Mobile and Desktop. Throughout the development, I was regularly
            pulled into calls to help diagnose issues with the project and suggest patterns to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            I became responsible for migrating the performance testing platform Quantify from EC2 to Kubernetes,
            redesigning its architecture entirely to reduce its operating costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Frontend of the Quantify Web application uses an outdated and unsupported React framework called Create
            React App. I migrated the entire project to React Router framework, making the minimum necessary changes
            needed to make the Web app work without changing its behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Over time, I optimised the responsiveness of the React frontend using Functional principles React excels
            with, by removing unneeded state changes, making full use of React's caching mechanisms.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the backend side, I slowly changed the old Spring Boot code to Spring Boot WebFlux, and it proved to be
            an improvement to the responsiveness of the backend.
          </li>
          <li>
            I made each microservice stateless so multiple instances can start and stop on demand without the need to
            sync up state.
          </li>
          <li>
            I reduced the amount of locking needed when executing PostgreSQL queries in parallel, by reducing the amount
            of unnecessary dependencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            I did Ahead-Of-Time compilation using GraalVM to reduce startup times, allowing services to better respond
            to sudden high loads, while also reducing overall resource usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            I cached data transformations in-memory using Redis, reducing compute time and increasing responsiveness
            for recently accessed web resources whose dependent data hasn't changed since last access.
          </li>
          <li>
            I allowed asynchronous communication between services using RabbitMQ, allowing the services to communicate
            changes to their data without interrupting current processes and without having services wait for each other
            to respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            I compressed each microservice into a single, small, independent executable that the Linux kernel
            can run directly without any additional programs, deamons, nor libraries, reducing a lot of overhead costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used OAuth2 to create a decentralized Authentication and Authorization mechanism to help manage security
            where private resources are distributed across multiple microservices.
          </li>
          <li>
            I wrote Terraform scripts that allows anyone to deploy the Quantify application to their cloud platform in
            an automated way. It also deploys to different cloud services rather than being attached to a specific cloud
            service like AWS.
          </li>

        <h4>Singapore Army / Corporal / Nov 2019 - Nov 2021</h4>
        <p>
          As part of my national service, I was enlisted to the Singapore Army. I mainly worked as a carrier, shipping
          classified documents between army bases. I adhered to rigorous security procedures, sent live reports, and
          kept to a tight schedule. I often used python scripts on my phone to help automate the process.

        <h4>Trampolene / Mobile Application Developer / May 2018 - Oct 2019</h4>
        <p>
          I spearheaded the initial design and development of Trampolene's various different Desktop, Web and Mobile
          applications, mainly targeting the Healthcare sector. I was involved in the entire Software Development
          Lifecycle of these applications.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using C#, Unity, and Vuforia, I made an Android Mobile app that provided immersive Augmented Reality
            experiences to seniors suffering from Dementia. Using markers placed around the room, I was able to overlay
            iconic landmarks from the patient's childhood into the environment and have them interact with these
            childhood memories as if they were there.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also implemented a learning app designed to teach life skills to special needs children. Using Flutter and
            Dart, I was able to deploy a Web, Desktop, and Mobile version of the application, for classroom and personal
            use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since I was fully responsible for the design of these applications, I had to design the UI/UX of each
            application myself, coding mockups of them to present to the client to see if they're adequate before
            actually implementing the actual features.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was responsible for setting up the Continuous Integration pipelines of these applications, setting them up
            in AppVeyor, writing unit tests, Bash scripts, configuring the environment, and sending the HTML report
            through e-mail.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reports also included performance measurements of the application, to help make better decisions on when
            optimisations should be made. My formal education on low-level computer architecture and analysing Algorithm
            Efficiency using Big O was used heavily to figure out why certain performance issues were happening
            and how to fix them.
          </li>
          <li>
            I very often had to meet with the company's clients myself, and explain to them how the application works
            without getting too technical, gathering feedback during the demo.
          </li>

        <h4>Nanyang Polytechnic / Game Development / April 2014 - Sept 2018</h4>
        <p>
          In order to reach the level of performance video games need to simulate worlds in real-time, I studied
          algorithms that are highly optimised for multicore memory hierarchies, allowing them to utilise all CPU cores
          efficiently. I implemented these algorithms in C/C++ for various projects.
